**Project Objective**

The goal of this project is to evaluate the performance of various classifiers and derive actionable insights from the models. We utilize data from a Portuguese banking institution, which includes details on customer engagement, personal and financial characteristics, and their response to previous marketing campaigns. The primary focus is to determine the outcome of customer conversion.

In the current marketing landscape, mass advertising is becoming increasingly inefficient due to its low return on investment and potential to frustrate uninterested customers. Targeted advertising and precision marketing have emerged as effective strategies, allowing businesses to concentrate their marketing efforts on customers most likely to convert. Classification methods play a crucial role in this approach by analyzing historical data to identify key predictive features and applying these insights to forecast customer behavior.

**Initial Approach**
Our analysis began with the development of a baseline model, utilizing the accuracy metric of a simplistic model that predicts the most frequent outcome of the target variable, in this case, 'no conversion'. This baseline, with an accuracy of 88.7%, served as a comparison point for more sophisticated models to ensure they provide a tangible improvement.

**Model Comparison**
We evaluated four classification models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Initially, we implemented a basic version of each model using default parameters and a reduced feature set to compare their accuracy and runtime. The accuracy scores for the test set were as follows:

KNN: 87.7%
Logistic Regression: 88.7%
Decision Tree: 93.4%
SVM: 88.7%
Feature Engineering and Model Tuning
Subsequent steps involved feature engineering to diminish the total number of features and employing grid search techniques on each model's hyperparameters to identify the most effective configurations. Despite finding models that surpassed the baseline accuracies, it's crucial to recognize that 'accuracy' alone is not the sole measure of success in classification models, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets. Therefore, we also examined precision/recall scores at varying threshold levels.

Given the business context of a marketing campaign, where the cost of a false positive is relatively low, but a false negative represents a significant missed opportunity, opting for a classifier with a lower threshold proved to be the correct strategy.

**Model Recommendations**
For KNN, an 'n_neighbors' value of 29 with a threshold (T) of 0.3 was recommended, balancing accuracy with a substantial increase in recall. For Logistic Regression, L1 regularization with C=0.01 and a T=0.3 was optimal, improving feature selection and interpretability while enhancing recall.

Notably, the Decision Tree model, with a max_depth of 4 and min_samples_split of 0.01, demonstrated superior performance in balancing accuracy with recall, particularly valuable given the dataset's imbalance.

**Conclusion**
The analysis underscores the computational efficiency and predictive accuracy of Decision Trees compared to KNN and Logistic Regression, especially in scenarios requiring new data classification. Post-analysis, applying KNN to the top features identified through Logistic Regression yielded comparable results to the Decision Tree, suggesting a dual approach for future predictions.

**Business Recommendations**
Based on the analysis, we advise focusing marketing efforts on the critical features identified through Logistic Regression L1 regularization. Specifically, targeting customers more likely to convert, such as those with positive responses to previous campaigns or demographic indicators like being a student or retired in March. Conversely, resources should be diverted from leads exhibiting characteristics negatively correlated with conversion.

Furthermore, the Decision Tree model, with optimized parameters, can provide a practical tool for assessing the conversion potential of new leads, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of marketing strategies.
